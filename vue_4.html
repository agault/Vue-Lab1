				{character:'LADY MACBETH', dialogue:"Was the hope drunk\nWherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\nAt what it did so freely? From this time\nSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeard\nTo be the same in thine own act and valour\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\nWhich thou esteem'st the ornament of life,\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\nLetting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'\nLike the poor cat i' the adage?"}

		//step 1: Run the code above!
		 v-for directive can be used for displaying a list 
    	of items using the data from an Array:

		v-for="singular in plural"	<-	plural will be defined in data. singular defined in for statement and used as a sinular.***soomedata
		
		You can also render loops using vue.js. The syntax used is a "foreach" style.
		plural must be defined somewhere. In our case it's as a data property
		singular is defined on the fly.
		
		
		ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING EXERCISE
		1. Add the next line through the console using app.scene.push() in the console
			app.scene.push({character:'MACBETH', dialogue:" I dare do all that may become a man Who dares do more is none."})

		2. Use v-if to style the text. Red if Macbeth is speaking, blue if Lady Macbeth 
			Diologue styled using classes to style
		3. The lines are separated by \n. Can you re-structure the data and logic so that the dialogue has many lines, each line separate?
